 no it was n't black monday 
 but while the new york stock exchange did n't fall apart friday as the dow jones industrial average plunged N points most of it in the final hour it barely managed to stay this side of chaos 
 some circuit breakers installed after the october N crash failed their first test traders say unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures 
 the N stock specialist firms on the big board floor the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the N crash once again could n't handle the selling pressure 
 big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock traders say 
 heavy selling of standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures in chicago <unk> beat stocks downward 
 seven big board stocks ual amr bankamerica walt disney capital cities\/abc philip morris and pacific telesis group stopped trading and never resumed 
 the <unk> has already begun 
 the equity market was <unk> 
 once again the specialists were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the new york stock exchange said christopher <unk> senior vice president at <unk> securities corp 
 <unk> james <unk> chairman of specialists henderson brothers inc. it is easy to say the specialist is n't doing his job 
 when the dollar is in a <unk> even central banks ca n't stop it 
 speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market 
 many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early friday afternoon on a warm autumn day because the stock market was so quiet 
 then in a <unk> plunge the dow jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year <unk> up a 190.58-point or N N loss on the day in <unk> trading volume 
 <unk> trading accelerated to N million shares a record for the big board 
 at the end of the day N million shares were traded 
 the dow jones industrials closed at N 
 the dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the <unk> black monday crash that occurred oct. N N 
 in percentage terms however the dow 's dive was the <unk> ever and the sharpest since the market fell N or N N a week after black monday 
 the dow fell N N on black monday 
 shares of ual the parent of united airlines were extremely active all day friday reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ N billion buy-out of the airline by an <unk> group 
 wall street 's takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and ual stock would rise 
 at N p.m. edt came the <unk> news the big board was <unk> trading in ual pending news 
 on the exchange floor as soon as ual stopped trading we <unk> for a panic said one top floor trader 
 several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news <unk> 
 for weeks the market had been nervous about takeovers after campeau corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers 
 and N minutes after the ual trading halt came news that the ual group could n't get financing for its bid 
 at this point the dow was down about N points 
 the market <unk> 
 arbitragers could n't dump their ual stock but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock they had 
 for example their selling caused trading halts to be declared in usair group which closed down N N to N N delta air lines which fell N N to N N and <unk> industries which sank N to N N 
 these stocks eventually reopened 
 but as panic spread speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as philip morris and international business machines to offset their losses 
 when trading was halted in philip morris the stock was trading at N down N N while ibm closed N N lower at N 
 selling <unk> because of waves of automatic stop-loss orders which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels 
 most of the stock selling pressure came from wall street professionals including computer-guided program traders 
 traders said most of their major institutional investors on the other hand sat tight 
 now at N one of the market 's post-crash reforms took hold as the s&p N futures contract had plunged N points equivalent to around a <unk> drop in the dow industrials 
 under an agreement signed by the big board and the chicago mercantile exchange trading was temporarily halted in chicago 
 after the trading halt in the s&p N pit in chicago waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the big board and specialists continued to <unk> prices down 
 as a result the link between the futures and stock markets <unk> apart 
 without the <unk> of stock-index futures the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the big board 
 the futures halt was even <unk> by big board floor traders 
 it <unk> things up said one major specialist 
 this confusion effectively halted one form of program trading stock index arbitrage that closely links the futures and stock markets and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings 
 in a stock-index arbitrage sell program traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference 
 when the airline information came through it <unk> every model we had for the marketplace said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms 
 we did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do 
 but stocks kept falling 
 the dow industrials were down N points at N p.m. before the <unk> halt 
 at N p.m. at the end of the cooling off period the average was down N points 
 meanwhile during the the s&p trading halt s&p futures sell orders began <unk> up while stocks in new york kept falling sharply 
 big board chairman john j. phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker worked well <unk> 
 i just think it 's <unk> at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things 
 under another post-crash system big board president richard <unk> mr. phelan was flying to <unk> as the market was falling was talking on an <unk> hot line to the other exchanges the securities and exchange commission and the federal reserve board 
 he <unk> out at a high-tech <unk> center on the floor of the big board where he could watch <unk> on prices and pending stock orders 
 at about N p.m. edt s&p futures resumed trading and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line 
 buyers stepped in to the futures pit 
 but the <unk> of s&p futures sell orders weighed on the market and the link with stocks began to fray again 
 at about N the s&p market <unk> to still another limit of N points down and trading was locked again 
 futures traders say the s&p was <unk> that the dow could fall as much as N points 
 during this time small investors began ringing their brokers wondering whether another crash had begun 
 at prudential-bache securities inc. which is trying to cater to small investors some <unk> brokers thought this would be the final <unk> 
 that 's when george l. ball chairman of the prudential insurance co. of america unit took to the internal <unk> system to declare that the plunge was only mechanical 
 i have a <unk> that this particular decline today is something more <unk> about less 
 it would be my <unk> to advise clients not to sell to look for an opportunity to buy mr. ball told the brokers 
 at merrill lynch & co. the nation 's biggest brokerage firm a news release was prepared <unk> merrill lynch comments on market drop 
 the release cautioned that there are significant differences between the current environment and that of october N and that there are still attractive investment opportunities in the stock market 
 however jeffrey b. lane president of shearson lehman hutton inc. said that friday 's plunge is going to set back relations with customers because it <unk> the concern of volatility 
 and i think a lot of people will <unk> on program trading 
 it 's going to bring the debate right back to the <unk> 
 as the dow average ground to its final N loss friday the s&p pit stayed locked at its <unk> trading limit 
 jeffrey <unk> of program trader <unk> investment group said N s&p contracts were for sale on the close the equivalent of $ N million in stock 
 but there were no buyers 
 while friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning traders said 
 stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself 
 at those levels stocks are set up to be <unk> by index arbitragers who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall and simultaneously sell off stocks 
 but nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today 
 the <unk> between the stock and futures markets friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether wall street is properly prepared for another crash situation 
 the big board 's mr. <unk> said our <unk> performance was good 
 but the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks 
 obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the <unk> obligations were n't met he said 
 see related story fed ready to <unk> big funds wsj oct. N N 
 but specialists complain privately that just as in the N crash the <unk> firms big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock stayed on the sidelines during friday 's <unk> 
 mr. phelan said it will take another day or two to analyze who was buying and selling friday

 ports of call inc. reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n't disclosed 
 the agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring 
 the company said a portion of the $ N million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended <unk> operations 
 earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of boeing co. <unk> because of increasing maintenance costs 
 a consortium of private investors operating as <unk> funding co. said it has made a $ N million cash bid for most of l.j. hooker corp. 's real-estate and <unk> holdings 
 the $ N million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $ N million in secured liabilities on those properties according to those making the bid 
 the group is led by jay <unk> chief executive officer of <unk> investment corp. in <unk> and a. boyd simpson chief executive of the atlanta-based simpson organization inc 
 mr. <unk> 's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $ N billion in assets mr. simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of l.j. hooker 
 the assets are good but they require more money and management than can be provided in l.j. hooker 's current situation said mr. simpson in an interview 
 hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell 
 we want to build and hold 
 l.j. hooker based in atlanta is operating with protection from its creditors under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code 
 its parent company hooker corp. of sydney australia is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional <unk> 
 sanford <unk> chief executive of l.j. hooker said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee 
 the $ N million bid is estimated by mr. simpson as representing N N of the value of all hooker real-estate holdings in the u.s. 
 not included in the bid are <unk> teller or b. altman & co. l.j. hooker 's department-store chains 
 the offer covers the massive N <unk> forest fair mall in cincinnati the N <unk> <unk> fashion mall in columbia s.c. and the N <unk> <unk> town center mall in <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> mall opened sept. N with a <unk> 's <unk> as its <unk> the columbia mall is expected to open nov. N 
 other hooker properties included are a <unk> office tower in <unk> atlanta expected to be completed next february vacant land sites in florida and ohio l.j. hooker international the commercial real-estate brokerage company that once did business as merrill lynch commercial real estate plus other shopping centers 
 the consortium was put together by <unk> <unk> the london-based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of security pacific corp 
 we do n't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid said <unk> campbell the head of mergers and acquisitions at <unk> <unk> in an interview 
 <unk> <unk> is acting as the consortium 's investment bankers 
 according to people familiar with the consortium the bid was <unk> project <unk> a reference to the film <unk> in which a <unk> played by actress <unk> <unk> is saved from a <unk> businessman by a police officer named john <unk> 
 l.j. hooker was a small <unk> company based in atlanta in N when mr. simpson was hired to push it into commercial development 
 the company grew modestly until N when a majority position in hooker corp. was acquired by australian developer george <unk> currently hooker 's chairman 
 mr. <unk> <unk> to launch an ambitious but <unk> $ N billion acquisition binge that included <unk> teller and b. altman & co. as well as majority positions in merksamer jewelers a sacramento chain <unk> inc. the <unk> retailer and <unk> inc. the southeast department-store chain 
 eventually mr. simpson and mr. <unk> had a falling out over the direction of the company and mr. simpson said he resigned in N 
 since then hooker corp. has sold its interest in the <unk> chain back to <unk> 's management and is currently attempting to sell the b. altman & co. chain 
 in addition robert <unk> chief executive of the <unk> chain is seeking funds to buy out the hooker interest in his company 
 the merksamer chain is currently being offered for sale by first boston corp 
 reached in <unk> mr. <unk> said that he believes the various hooker <unk> can become profitable with new management 
 these are n't mature assets but they have the potential to be so said mr. <unk> 
 managed properly and with a long-term outlook these can become investment-grade quality properties 
 canadian <unk> production totaled N metric tons in the week ended oct. N up N N from the preceding week 's total of N tons statistics canada a federal agency said

 as small investors <unk> their mutual funds with phone calls over the weekend big fund managers said they have a strong defense against any wave of withdrawals cash 
 unlike the weekend before black monday the funds were n't <unk> with heavy withdrawal requests 
 and many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week 
 at fidelity investments the nation 's largest fund company telephone volume was up sharply but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding black monday in N 
 the boston firm said <unk> redemptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago 
 as of yesterday afternoon the redemptions represented less than N N of the total cash position of about $ N billion of fidelity 's stock funds 
 two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around said c. bruce <unk> who runs fidelity investments ' $ N billion <unk> fund 
 this feels more like a <unk> deal 
 people are n't <unk> 
 the test may come today 
 friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act 
 some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices 
 stock fund redemptions during the N debacle did n't begin to <unk> until after the market opened on black monday 
 but fund managers say they 're ready 
 many have raised cash levels which act as a buffer against steep market declines 
 mario <unk> for instance holds cash positions well above N N in several of his funds 
 windsor fund 's john <unk> and mutual series ' michael price said they had raised their cash levels to more than N N and N N respectively this year 
 even peter lynch manager of fidelity 's $ N billion <unk> fund the nation 's largest stock fund built up cash to N N or $ N million 
 one reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in august and september 
 i 've let the money build up mr. lynch said who added that he has had trouble finding stocks he likes 
 not all funds have raised cash levels of course 
 as a group stock funds held N N of assets in cash as of august the latest figures available from the investment company institute 
 that was modestly higher than the N N and N N levels in august and september of N 
 also persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash 
 but a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around fund managers said 
 a major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since black monday 
 <unk> sales have rebounded in recent months but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half N levels 
 there 's not nearly as much <unk> said john <unk> chairman of vanguard group inc. a big valley forge pa. fund company 
 many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy 
 vincent <unk> manager of the $ N billion wellington fund added to his positions in bristol-myers squibb woolworth and dun & bradstreet friday 
 and today he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like eli lilly pfizer and american home products whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines 
 fidelity 's mr. lynch for his part snapped up southern co. shares friday after the stock got <unk> 
 if the market drops further today he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as bristol-myers and kellogg 
 if they <unk> stocks like that he said it presents an opportunity that is the kind of thing you dream about 
 major mutual-fund groups said phone calls were <unk> at twice the normal weekend pace yesterday 
 but most investors were seeking share prices and other information 
 trading volume was only modestly higher than normal 
 still fund groups are n't taking any chances 
 they hope to avoid the <unk> phone lines and other <unk> that <unk> some fund investors in october N 
 fidelity on saturday opened its N <unk> investor centers across the country 
 the centers normally are closed through the weekend 
 in addition east coast centers will open at N edt this morning instead of the normal N 
 t. rowe price associates inc. increased its staff of phone representatives to handle investor requests 
 the <unk> group noted that some investors moved money from stock funds to money-market funds 
 but most investors seemed to be in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode said steven <unk> a vice president 
 and vanguard among other groups said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through 
 in an unusual move several funds moved to calm investors with <unk> on their <unk> phone lines 
 we view friday 's market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors a recording at <unk> & co. funds said over the weekend 
 the <unk> group had a similar recording for investors 
 several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize 
 some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits 
 stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of N N through september according to lipper analytical services inc 
 <unk> <unk> who runs shearson lehman hutton inc. 's $ N million sector analysis portfolio predicts the market will open down at least N points on technical factors and some panic selling 
 but she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than N N to N N from recent highs 
 this is not a major crash she said 
 nevertheless ms. <unk> said she was <unk> with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders 
 half of them are really scared and want to sell she said but i 'm trying to talk them out of it 
 she added if they all were bullish i 'd really be upset 
 the backdrop to friday 's slide was <unk> different from that of the october N crash fund managers argue 
 two years ago unlike today the dollar was weak interest rates were rising and the market was very <unk> they say 
 from the investors ' standpoint institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson by selling at the lows on black monday said stephen boesel manager of the $ N million t. rowe price growth and income fund 
 this time i do n't think we 'll get a panic reaction 
 newport corp. said it expects to report <unk> earnings of between N cents and N cents a share somewhat below analysts ' estimates of N cents to N cents 
 the maker of scientific instruments and laser parts said orders fell below expectations in recent months 
 a spokesman added that sales in the current quarter will about equal the <unk> quarter 's figure when newport reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share on $ N million in sales 
 <unk> from the strike by N machinists union members against boeing co. reached air carriers friday as america west airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the seattle jet maker 
 peter <unk> vice president for planning at the phoenix ariz. carrier said in an interview that the work <unk> at boeing now entering its 13th day has caused some turmoil in our scheduling and that more than N passengers who were booked to fly out of houston on america west would now be put on other airlines 
 mr. <unk> said boeing told america west that the N it was supposed to get this thursday would n't be delivered until nov. N the day after the airline had been planning to <unk> service at houston with four daily flights including three <unk> to phoenix and one <unk> to las vegas 
 now those routes are n't expected to begin until jan 
 boeing is also supposed to send to america west another N <unk> aircraft as well as a N by year 's end 
 those too are almost certain to arrive late 
 at this point no other america west flights including its new service at san antonio texas newark n.j. and <unk> calif. have been affected by the delays in boeing deliveries 
 nevertheless the company 's reaction <unk> the <unk> effect that a huge manufacturer such as boeing can have on other parts of the economy 
 it also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company 
 i just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged <unk> tom baker president of machinists ' district N said in an interview yesterday 
 i do n't think their customers would like it very much 
 america west though is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be 
 i figure that american and united probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets they might not miss one at all mr. <unk> said 
 indeed a random check friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations 
 southwest airlines has a boeing N set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time 
 it 's so close to completion boeing 's told us there wo n't be a problem said a southwest spokesman 
 a spokesman for amr corp. said boeing has assured american airlines it will deliver a N on time later this month 
 american is preparing to take delivery of another N in early december and N more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable 
 in seattle a boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike 
 meanwhile supervisors and <unk> employees have been trying to finish some N aircraft mostly N and N jumbo jets at the company 's <unk> wash. plant that were all but completed before the <unk> 
 as of friday four had been delivered and a fifth plane a N was supposed to be <unk> out over the weekend to air china 
 no date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table 
 we want to make sure they know what they want before they come back said doug hammond the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began 
 the investment community for one has been anticipating a <unk> resolution 
 though boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market friday it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders 
 the market has taken two views that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very <unk> for boeing in the long term said howard <unk> an analyst at <unk> j. lawrence inc 
 boeing 's shares fell $ N friday to close at $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 but mr. baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month <unk> that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week 
 still he said it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer 
 i would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything 
 last week boeing chairman frank <unk> sent striking workers a letter saying that to my knowledge boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major u.s. industrial firm in recent history 
 but mr. baker called the letter and the company 's offer of a N N wage increase over the life of the pact plus bonuses very weak 
 he added that the company <unk> the union 's resolve and the workers ' <unk> with being forced to work many hours overtime 
 in separate developments talks have broken off between machinists representatives at lockheed corp. and the <unk> calif. aerospace company 
 the union is continuing to work through its expired contract however 
 it had planned a strike vote for next sunday but that has been pushed back indefinitely 
 united auto workers local N which represents N workers at boeing 's helicopter unit in delaware county pa. said it agreed to extend its contract on a <unk> basis with a <unk> notification to cancel while it continues bargaining 
 the accord expired yesterday 
 and boeing on friday said it received an order from <unk> <unk> for four model N <unk> <unk> valued at a total of about $ N million 
 the planes long range versions of the <unk> <unk> will be delivered with <unk> & <unk> <unk> engines 
 <unk> & <unk> is a unit of united technologies inc 
 <unk> <unk> is based in amsterdam 
 a boeing spokeswoman said a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out for a variety of reasons but not because of the strike

 <unk> ltd. said its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants some valued at more than one billion canadian dollars us$ N million in great britain and elsewhere 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> 's senior vice president finance said its <unk> canadian utilities ltd. unit is reviewing <unk> projects in eastern canada and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere including britain where the british government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program 
 the projects are big 
 they can be c$ N billion plus mr. <unk> said 
 but we would n't go into them alone and canadian utilities ' equity stake would be small he said 
 <unk> we 'd like to be the operator of the project and a modest equity investor 
 our long suit is our proven ability to operate power plants he said 
 mr. <unk> would n't offer <unk> regarding <unk> 's proposed british project but he said it would compete for customers with two huge british power generating companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to <unk> its massive water and electric utilities 
 britain 's government plans to raise about # N billion $ N billion from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities beginning next month 
 the planned electric utility sale scheduled for next year is alone expected to raise # N billion making it the world 's largest public offering 
 under terms of the plan independent <unk> would be able to compete for N N of customers until N and for another N N between N and N 
 canadian utilities had N revenue of c$ N billion mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in alberta where the company serves about N customers 
 there seems to be a move around the world to <unk> the generation of electricity mr. <unk> said and canadian utilities hopes to capitalize on it 
 this is a real thrust on our utility side he said adding that canadian utilities is also <unk> projects in <unk> countries though he would be specific 
 canadian utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in britain in anticipation of the privatization program 
 we 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in england said bruce <unk> vice president corporate strategy and corporate planning with enron corp. houston a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator 
 mr. <unk> said enron is considering building <unk> power plants in the u.k. capable of producing about N <unk> of power at a cost of about $ N million to $ N million 
 pse inc. said it expects to report third earnings of $ N million to $ N million or N cents to N cents a share 
 in the year-ago quarter the designer and operator of <unk> and waste heat recovery plants had net income of $ N or four cents a share on revenue of about $ N million 
 the company said the improvement is related to additional <unk> facilities that have been put into operation

 <unk> & broad home corp. said it formed a $ N million limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in california suitable for residential development 
 the partnership <unk> & broad land development venture limited partnership is a N joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of <unk> advisory corp. a unit of <unk> financial corp. a real estate advisory management and development company with offices in chicago and beverly hills calif 
 <unk> & broad a home building company declined to identify the institutional investors 
 the land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received <unk> and other approvals required for development and part of <unk> & broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals 
 the partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development but in return it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices which can result in sizable savings said bruce <unk> president and chief executive officer of <unk> & broad 
 there are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash 
 typically developers option property and then once they get the administrative approvals they buy it said mr. <unk> adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind 
 we usually operate in that conservative manner 
 by setting up the joint venture <unk> & broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land while avoiding the negative <unk> to its own balance sheet mr. <unk> said 
 the company is putting up only N N of the capital although it is responsible for providing management planning and processing services to the joint venture 
 this is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company mr. <unk> said 
 when the price of plastics took off in N quantum chemical corp. went along for the ride 
 the timing of quantum 's chief executive officer john <unk> <unk> appeared to be nothing less than inspired because he had just increased quantum 's reliance on plastics 
 the company <unk> much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew <unk> in two years 
 mr. <unk> said of the boom it 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks 
 but now prices have <unk> and quantum 's profit is <unk> 
 some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter compared with year-earlier profit of $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N million 
 the stock having lost nearly a quarter of its value since sept. N closed at $ N share down $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading friday 
 to a degree quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that <unk> modern life 
 having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history these producers now see their prices eroding 
 pricing cycles to be sure are nothing new for plastics producers 
 and the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the <unk> period that is just behind them 
 we were all wonderful heroes last year says an executive at one of quantum 's competitors 
 now we 're at the bottom of the <unk> 
 at quantum which is based in new york the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy <unk> on plastics 
 once known as national <unk> & chemical corp. the company <unk> the wine and spirits business and <unk> more of its resources into plastics after mr. <unk> took the chief executive 's job in N 
 mr. <unk> N years old declined to be interviewed for this article but he has consistently argued that over the long haul across both the <unk> and the <unk> of the plastics market quantum will <unk> through its new direction 
 quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene <unk> used to make garbage bags milk <unk> <unk> toys and meat packaging among other items 
 in the u.s. polyethylene market quantum has claimed the largest share about N N 
 but its competitors including dow chemical co. union carbide corp. and several oil giants have much broader business interests and so are better <unk> against price swings 
 when the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound quantum 's annual profit <unk> by about N cents a share provided no other <unk> are changing 
 in recent months the price of polyethylene even more than that of other commodity plastics has taken a dive 
 benchmark grades which still sold for as much as N cents a pound last spring have skidded to between N cents and N cents 
 meanwhile the price of <unk> the chemical building block of polyethylene has n't dropped nearly so fast 
 that <unk> <unk> quantum badly because its own plants cover only about half of its <unk> needs 
 by many accounts an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year 
 china which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene abruptly halted them 
 <unk> that excess polyethylene would soon be <unk> around the world other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product 
 kenneth mitchell director of dow 's polyethylene business says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices <unk> up 
 people were even <unk> bags he says 
 now producers hope prices have hit bottom

 a quick turnaround is crucial to quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy 
 the company is trying to carry out a three-year $ N billion <unk> program started this year 
 at the same time its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ N million largely because of debt taken on to pay a $ <unk> special dividend earlier this year 
 quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the <unk> with its holders because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases 
 some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to <unk> takeover speculation 
 whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend raised N N to N cents a share only a year ago has become a topic of intense speculation on wall street since mr. <unk> <unk> dividend questions in a sept. N meeting with analysts 
 some viewed his response that company directors review the dividend regularly as nothing more than the standard line from executives 
 but others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual <unk> performance 
 in any case on the day of the meeting quantum 's shares slid $ N to $ N in big board trading 
 on top of everything else quantum <unk> a disaster at its plant in morris ill 
 after an explosion <unk> the plant in june the company <unk> in september to within N hours of completing the <unk> process of <unk> it 
 then a second explosion occurred 
 two workers died and six remain in the hospital 
 this human toll adds the most painful <unk> yet to the sudden change in quantum 's fortunes 
 until this year the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up <unk> safety <unk> 
 a prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another <unk> into quantum 's financial future 
 when a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand <unk> lost profit and thus claims under <unk> insurance is <unk> 
 but the numbers become <unk> and subject to <unk> between insured and insurer when demand is shifting 
 you say you could have sold x percent of this product and <unk> percent of that recalls <unk> <unk> an analyst at shearson lehman hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer 
 and then you still have to negotiate 
 quantum hopes the morris plant where limited production got under way last week will resume full operation by year 's end 
 the plant usually accounts for N N to N N of quantum 's polyethylene production and N N of its <unk> production 
 not everything looks grim for quantum 
 the plant expansion should strengthen the company 's <unk> in the polyethylene business where market share is often taken through sheer capacity 
 by lifting <unk> production the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs 
 quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals propane marketing 
 through a venture with its investment banker first boston corp. quantum completed in august an acquisition of <unk> inc. in a transaction valued at $ N billion 
 <unk> is the second-largest propane distributor in the u.s. 
 the largest suburban propane was already owned by quantum 
 still quantum has a crisis to get past right now 
 some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor 
 the name <unk> in rumors is british petroleum co. which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the u.s. 
 asked about a bid for quantum a <unk> spokesman says we pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors and i think that falls in that category 
 rjr nabisco inc. is <unk> its division responsible for buying network advertising time just a month after moving N of the group 's N employees to new york from atlanta 
 a spokesman for the new york-based food and tobacco giant taken private earlier this year in a $ N billion leveraged buy-out by kohlberg kravis roberts & co. confirmed that it is <unk> down the rjr nabisco broadcast unit and <unk> its N employees in a move to save money 
 the spokesman said rjr is discussing its <unk> plans with its two main advertising firms <unk> katz and <unk> <unk> 
 we found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost said the spokesman who declined to specify how much rjr spends on network television time 
 an executive close to the company said rjr is spending about $ N million on network television time this year down from roughly $ N million last year 
 the spokesman said the broadcast unit will be <unk> dec. N and the move wo n't affect rjr 's print radio and <unk> buying practices 
 the broadcast group had been based in new york until a year ago when rjr 's previous management moved it to atlanta the company 's headquarters before this summer 
 one employee with the group said rjr moved N employees of the group back to new york in september because there was supposed to be a future 
 he said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies 
 the rjr spokesman said the company moved the N employees to new york last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' <unk> season

 the u.s. which is <unk> its <unk> quotas is <unk> a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively <unk> steel industries 
 meanwhile the u.s. has negotiated a significant cut in japan 's steel quota and made only a minor increase to the steel <unk> for the european community 
 brazil similar to mexico and south korea is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the u.s. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas which expired sept. N 
 brazil and venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the u.s. for the year ending oct. N N 
 in recent years u.s. steelmakers have supplied about N N of the N million tons of steel used annually by the nation 
 of the remaining N N needed the <unk> negotiations <unk> about N N to foreign suppliers with the difference supplied mainly by canada which is n't included in the quota program 
 other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the u.s. such as taiwan sweden and argentina also have supplied steel 
 some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the u.s. that are similar to quotas 
 the bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas known as voluntary restraint agreements until march N N 
 it also said it would use that <unk> year period to work toward an international consensus on <unk> up the international steel trade which has been <unk> managed subsidized and protected by governments 
 the u.s. termed its plan a trade <unk> program despite the fact that it is merely an extension 
 mexico which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the u.s. virtually doubled its quota to N N of the u.s. steel market from N N under the previous quotas 
 south korea which had N N under the previous quotas is set to get a small increase to about N N 
 that increase rises to slightly more than N N of the u.s. market if a joint <unk> steel project is included 
 meanwhile brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the N N share it has had in recent years 
 the ec and japan the u.s. 's largest steel suppliers have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent 
 the ec steel industry which has been coping with strong european demand has been supplying about N N of the u.s. market compared with recent quotas of about N N 
 japan has been shipping steel to total about N N of the u.s. market compared with a quota of N N 
 in the recent talks the ec had its quota increased about N tons to N N of the u.s. market from N N in N 
 but its quota has been as high as N N in N 
 japan however has agreed to cut its quota to about N N from N N previously 
 japan the ec brazil mexico and south korea provide about N N of the steel imported to the u.s. under the quota program 
 the balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters such as australia and venezuela 
 the u.s. had about an extra N N of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks 
 that was essentially made up of a N N increase in the overall quota program and N N from cutting japan 's allowance 
 negotiators from the white house trade office will repeat these quota negotiations next year when they will have another N N of the u.s. steel market to <unk> 
 these <unk> <unk> increases to the steel quota program are built into the bush administration 's <unk> program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and <unk> from their own steel industries 
 <unk> inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail N results but anticipates that several new products will lead to a much stronger performance in its second half 
 <unk> a telecommunications company had net income of $ N or five cents a share in its year-earlier second quarter ended sept. N 
 revenue totaled $ N million 
 george <unk> chairman and chief executive officer said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ N million 
 the lower results mr. <unk> said reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones <unk> 's primary business 
 although mr. <unk> expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year he said <unk> will also benefit from moving into other areas 
 <unk> among those is the company 's <unk> into the public facsimile business mr. <unk> said 
 within the next year <unk> expects to place N fax machines made by <unk> in japan in hotels municipal buildings <unk> and other public <unk> around the country 
 <unk> will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect store and forward billing data 
 mr. <unk> said <unk> should realize a minimum of $ N of <unk> net earnings for each machine each month 
 <unk> has also developed an automatic call <unk> that will make further use of the company 's system for <unk> and handling credit-card calls and collect calls 
 automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone mr. <unk> said not just phones produced by <unk> 
 the company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones which do n't accept coins for use in hotel <unk> office <unk> <unk> <unk> and similar <unk> 
 mr. <unk> estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ N of <unk> net earnings for each machine each month

 measuring <unk> may soon be replaced by <unk> in the <unk> room 
 procter & gamble co. plans to begin testing next month a <unk> detergent that will require only a few <unk> per <unk> 
 the move stems from <unk> learned in japan where local competitors have had <unk> success with concentrated <unk> 
 it also marks p&g 's growing concern that its japanese rivals such as <unk> corp. may bring their <unk> to the u.s. 
 the cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in japan when <unk> introduced a powerful detergent called attack which quickly won a N N stake in the japanese markets 
 they do n't want to get caught again says one industry <unk> 
 retailers in phoenix ariz. say p&g 's new <unk> detergent to be called <unk> with color guard will be on shelves in that market by early november 
 a p&g spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to phoenix started late last month 
 she said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others 
 <unk> are n't entirely new for p&g 
 the company introduced a <unk> <unk> <unk> in japan after watching the success of attack 
 when attack hit the shelves in N p&g 's share of the japanese market fell to about N N from more than N N 
 with the help of <unk> <unk> p&g 's share is now estimated to be N N 
 while the japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products the true test for p&g will be in the $ N billion u.s. detergent market where growth is slow and <unk> have gained <unk> over <unk> 
 the company may have chosen to market the product under the <unk> name since it 's already expanded its <unk> tide into N different <unk> including this year 's big hit tide with <unk> 
 with <unk> however it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more many people tend to dump too much detergent into the <unk> machine <unk> that it takes a cup of <unk> to really clean the <unk> 
 in the early 1980s p&g tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the <unk> brand name that it markets in europe 
 but the product which was n't as concentrated as the new <unk> <unk> in a market test in denver and was dropped 
 p&g and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric <unk> <unk> in <unk> but they have n't sold well despite the convenience 
 but p&g contends the new <unk> is a unique formula that also offers an <unk> that prevents colors from <unk> 
 and retailers are expected to <unk> the product in part because it will take up less shelf space 
 when shelf space was cheap bigger was better says <unk> <unk> an analyst at salomon <unk> 
 but with so many brands <unk> for space that 's no longer the case 
 if the new <unk> sells well the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own <unk> 
 then retailers will probably push the <unk> brands out altogether he says 
 competition is bound to get tougher if <unk> <unk> a product like attack in the u.s. 
 to be sure <unk> would n't have an easy time taking u.s. market share away from the mighty p&g which has about N N of the market 
 <unk> officials previously have said they are interested in selling <unk> in the u.s. but so far the company has focused on acquisitions such as last year 's purchase of andrew <unk> co. a cincinnati <unk> maker 
 it also has a <unk> facility in california 
 some believe p&g 's interest in a <unk> detergent goes beyond the concern for the japanese 
 this is something p&g would do with or without <unk> says mr. <unk> 
 with economic tension between the u.s. and japan worsening many japanese had feared last week 's visit from u.s. trade representative carla hills 
 they expected a new <unk> of demands that japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the u.s. 
 instead they got a discussion of the need for the u.s. and japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view 
 mrs. hills ' first trip to japan as america 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by commerce secretary robert a. mosbacher 
 mr. mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade 
 he said such results should be <unk> in dollars and cents in reducing the u.s. trade deficit with japan 
 but mrs. hills speaking at a breakfast meeting of the american chamber of commerce in japan on saturday stressed that the objective is not to get definitive action by spring or summer it is rather to have a blueprint for action 
 she added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment some small step to convince the american people and the japanese people that we 're moving in <unk> 
 how such remarks translate into policy wo n't become clear for months 
 american and japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach <unk> mr. mosbacher and mrs. hills 
 many called it simply a contrast in styles 
 but some saw it as a classic negotiating <unk> 
 others said the bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand 
 and some said it reflected the growing debate in washington over pursuing free trade with japan <unk> some kind of managed trade 
 asked to compare her visit to mr. mosbacher 's mrs. hills replied i did n't hear every word he spoke but as a general proposition i think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the bush administration 
 yet more than one american official who sat in with her during three days of talks with japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly <unk> 
 i think my line has been very consistent mrs. hills said at a news conference saturday afternoon 
 i am painted sometimes as <unk> perhaps because i have a <unk> list of statutes to implement 
 i do n't feel very <unk> 
 i do n't feel either hard or soft 
 i feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade 
 when she met the local press for the first time on friday mrs. hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products <unk> and <unk> three areas targeted under the <unk> N provision of the N trade bill 
 she <unk> <unk> business practices that the u.s. government has identified 
 but her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition 
 she said the trade <unk> was mainly due to <unk> factors and should n't be <unk> by setting <unk> targets 
 at her news conference for japanese reporters one economics journalist <unk> up the japanese sense of relief 
 my impression was that you would be a scary old lady he said drawing a few nervous <unk> from his colleagues 
 but i am relieved to see that you are beautiful and <unk> and <unk> and a person of integrity 
 mrs. hills ' remarks did raise questions at least among some u.s. officials about what exactly her stance is on u.s. access to the japanese semiconductor market 
 the u.s. share of the japanese market has been stuck around N N for years 
 many americans have interpreted a N agreement as <unk> u.s. companies a N N share by N but the japanese have denied making any such promise 
 at one of her news conferences mrs. hills said i believe we can do much better than N N

 traditional industries inc. said it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter that ended june N and is seeking new financing 
 the seller of photographic products and services said it is considering a number of financing alternatives including seeking increases in its credit lines 
 traditional declined to estimate the amount of the loss and would n't say if it expects to show a profit for the year 
 in the year ended june N N traditional reported net income of $ N million or $ N a share 
 the company did n't break out its fourth-quarter results 
 in the latest nine months net income was $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million 
 separately the company said it would file a delayed <unk> report with the securities and exchange commission within approximately N days 
 it said the delay resulted from difficulties in <unk> its accounting of a settlement with the federal trade commission 
 under an agreement filed in federal court in august to settle ftc objections to some traditional sales practices traditional said it would establish a $ N trust fund to provide refunds to certain customers 
 information international inc. said it was sued by a buyer of its computerized <unk> system alleging that the company failed to correct deficiencies in the system 
 a spokesman for information international said the lawsuit by two units of morris communications corp. seeks <unk> of the system 's about $ N million purchase price and cancellation of a software license provided by the morris units to information international for alleged failure to pay royalties 
 information international said it believes that the complaints filed in federal court in georgia are without merit 
 closely held morris communications is based in <unk> <unk> 
 the units that filed the suit are <unk> newspapers corp. and florida publishing co 
 <unk> corp. completed the sale of its a. <unk> & co. subsidiary a men 's luxury <unk> to <unk> investments

 the oil industry 's <unk> profits could <unk> through the rest of the year 
 major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability 
 the gasoline picture may improve this quarter but chemicals are likely to remain weak industry executives and analysts say reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance 
 the industry is seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals glenn cox president of phillips petroleum co. said in an interview 
 that change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general he added 
 he did n't forecast phillips 's results 
 but securities analysts say phillips will be among the companies <unk> by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings 
 so too many analysts predict will exxon corp. chevron corp. and amoco corp 
 typical is what happened to the price of <unk> a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies 
 it has plunged N N since july to around N cents a pound 
 a year ago <unk> sold for N cents <unk> at about N cents last december 
 a big reason for the chemical price retreat is <unk> 
 beginning in <unk> prices began accelerating as a growing u.s. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand 
 companies added capacity <unk> 
 now greatly increased supplies are on the market while the dollar is stronger and domestic economic growth is slower 
 third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker 
 refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year said william <unk> a securities analyst at first boston corp 
 oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in july and august that did n't <unk> 
 the excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period 
 in addition crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier further <unk> profitability 
 refiners say margins picked up in september and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter though still not to the level of N 's fourth quarter 
 during the N second half many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits 
 crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year 
 prices averaging roughly $ N a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier have stayed well above most companies ' expectations 
 demand has been much stronger than anticipated and it typically <unk> in the fourth quarter 
 we could see higher oil prices this year said <unk> <unk> an analyst at painewebber inc 
 that will translate into sharply higher production profits particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ N a barrel in the fourth quarter 
 while oil prices have been better than expected natural gas prices have been worse 
 in the third quarter they averaged about N N less than they were in N 
 the main reason remains weather 
 last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to <unk> more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air <unk> use 
 this summer on the other hand had <unk> weather than usual 
 we 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices said mr. cox phillips 's president 
 the lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected 
 going into the fourth quarter natural gas prices are anywhere from N N to N N lower than a year earlier 
 for instance natural gas currently produced along the gulf coast is selling on the spot market for around $ N a thousand cubic feet down N N from $ N a thousand cubic feet a year ago 
 the bush administration trying to blunt growing demands from western europe for a <unk> of controls on exports to the soviet bloc is questioning whether italy 's <unk> c. olivetti & co. supplied <unk> valuable technology to the soviets 
 most of the western european members of <unk> committee on <unk> export controls the <unk> forum through which the u.s. and its allies <unk> their <unk> policies are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in paris oct. N and N 
 they plan to press specifically for a <unk> of rules governing exports of machine tools computers and other high-technology products 
 but the bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all cocom members are <unk> fully with existing <unk> procedures before it will support further <unk> 
 to make its point it is challenging the italian government to explain reports that olivetti may have supplied the soviet union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft 
 the london sunday times which first reported the u.s. concerns cited a u.s. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that olivetti exported $ N million in <unk> <unk> flexible manufacturing systems to the soviet aviation industry 
 olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in N 
 a state department spokesman acknowledged that the u.s. is discussing the allegations with the italian government and cocom but declined to confirm any details 
 italian president <unk> <unk> promised a quick investigation into whether olivetti broke cocom rules 
 president bush called his attention to the matter during the italian leader 's visit here last week 
 olivetti has denied that it violated cocom rules <unk> that the reported shipments were properly licensed by the italian authorities 
 although the <unk> of these sales is still an open question the disclosure could n't be better <unk> to support the position of <unk> <unk> in the pentagon and the intelligence community 
 it seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important cocom meeting said a washington lobbyist for a number of u.s. computer companies 
 the bush administration has sent <unk> signals about its <unk> policies reflecting <unk> divisions among several competing agencies 
 last summer mr. bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual <unk> when he told a north atlantic treaty organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the cocom <unk> of strategic goods 
 but more recently the pentagon and the commerce department openly <unk> over the extent to which cocom should <unk> exports of personal computers to the bloc 
 however these agencies generally agree that the west should be cautious about any further <unk> 
 there 's no evidence that the soviet program to illegally acquire western technology has diminished said a state department spokesman 
 salomon brothers international ltd. a british subsidiary of salomon inc. announced it will issue warrants on shares of hong kong telecommunications ltd 
 the move closely follows a similar offer by salomon of warrants for shares of <unk> & shanghai banking corp 
 under the latest offer hk$ N million us$ N million of three-year warrants will be issued in london each giving buyers the right to buy one hong kong telecommunications share at a price to be determined friday 
 the N million warrants will be priced at hk$ N each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about N N 
 in trading on the stock exchange of hong kong the shares closed wednesday at hk$ N each 
 at this price the shares would have to rise above hk$ N for subscribers to salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants 
 while hong kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party 
 salomon will cover the warrants by buying sufficient shares or options to purchase shares to cover its entire position 
 bankers said warrants for hong kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk 
 the hong kong telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in europe the bankers added because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the hong kong market that has international appeal

 friday 's <unk> selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the u.s. report might have had and sent the november orange <unk> contract down as much as N cents a pound at one time 
 it settled with a loss of N cents at $ N a pound 
 brazilian <unk> after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season is beginning to arrive in the u.s. in large quantities 
 brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product which is going to be in <unk> supply 
 the price cut one analyst said appeared to be aimed even more at europe where consumption of brazilian <unk> has fallen 
 it 's a <unk> product and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in europe the analyst said 
 new york futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ N a pound at midyear 
 barring a cold <unk> or other crop problems in the growing areas downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into january when <unk> and processing of <unk> in florida reach their peak the analyst said 
 energy 
 although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of friday 's leap in crude oil prices last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week 
 i would continue to look for a stable crude market at least in futures trading said william <unk> an energy futures broker with <unk> & co 
 friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets 
 on the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate crude for november delivery finished at $ N a barrel up N cents on the day 
 on european markets meanwhile spot prices of north sea <unk> were up N to N cents a barrel 
 this market still wants to go higher said <unk> <unk> a first vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc 
 he predicted that the november contract will reach $ N a barrel or more on the new york mercantile exchange 
 there has been little news to account for such <unk> in the oil markets 
 analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and <unk> 
 there also are <unk> reports that the soviet union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that <unk> has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell 
 many traders <unk> a tightening of near-term supplies particularly of high-quality <unk> such as those produced in the north sea and in <unk> 
 if a hostile <unk> emerges for saatchi & saatchi co. <unk> charles and maurice saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt an official close to the company said 
 financing for any takeover attempt may be <unk> in the wake of friday 's stock-market sell-off in new york and turmoil in the junk-bond market 
 but the beleaguered british advertising and consulting giant which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace maurice saatchi has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks 
 last week saatchi 's largest shareholder <unk> asset management said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring 
 and carl spielvogel chief executive officer of saatchi 's big backer spielvogel bates advertising unit said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company but was rebuffed by charles saatchi 
 mr. spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid 
 the executive close to saatchi & saatchi said that if a bidder came up with a <unk> high offer a crazy offer which saatchi knew it could n't beat it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders 
 but otherwise it would undoubtedly come back with an offer by management 
 the executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board whose chairman is maurice saatchi and whose strategic <unk> force is believed to be charles saatchi 
 mr. spielvogel is n't part of the board nor are any of the other heads of saatchi 's big <unk> ad agencies 
 the executive did n't name any price but securities analysts have said saatchi would fetch upward of $ N billion 
 the executive denied speculation that saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back 
 that speculation <unk> friday as industry executives <unk> the appointment of the new chief executive robert <unk> who joins saatchi and becomes a member of its board on jan. N 
 mr. <unk> formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm <unk> international inc. has a reputation as a <unk> financial manager and will be charged largely with <unk> saatchi 's poor financial state 
 asked about the speculation that mr. <unk> has been hired to <unk> the way for a buy-out by the brothers the executive replied that is n't the reason dreyfus has been brought in 
 he was brought in to turn around the company 
 separately several saatchi agency clients said they believe the company 's management <unk> will have little affect on them 
 it has n't had any impact on us nor do we expect it to said a spokeswoman for miller brewing co. a major client of backer spielvogel 
 john <unk> director of advertising at painewebber inc. a saatchi & saatchi advertising client said we have no problem with the announcement because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about 
 we are n't going to change agencies because of a change in london 
 executives at backer spielvogel client <unk> inc. as well as at saatchi client <unk> lighting co. also said they saw no effect 
 executives at prudential-bache securities inc. a backer spielvogel client that is reviewing its account declined comment 
 mr. spielvogel had said that prudential-bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring or a buy-out of backer spielvogel alone led by him

 <unk> products inc. said a u.s. district court in boston ruled that a challenge by <unk> to the <unk> of a u.s. patent held by <unk> inc. was without merit

 the patent is related to <unk> acid a <unk> extract used in eye surgery 
 in its lawsuit <unk> is seeking unspecified damages and a preliminary injunction to block <unk> from selling the <unk> products 
 a <unk> spokesman said the products contribute about a third of <unk> 's sales and N N to N N of its earnings

 <unk> said the court 's ruling was issued as part of a <unk> trial in the <unk> proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case 
 it said it is considering all of its options in light of the decision including a possible appeal 
 the <unk> company added that it plans to <unk> its other defenses against <unk> 's lawsuit including the claim that it has n't infringed on <unk> 's patent 
 <unk> said that the court scheduled a conference for next monday to set a date for proceedings on <unk> 's motion for a preliminary injunction 
 newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third-quarter results aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising <unk> especially in the northeast 
 adding to <unk> in the industry seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general <unk> within the retail industry 
 in new york the <unk> teller and b. altman & co. department stores have filed for protection from creditors under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code while the r.h. macy & co. bloomingdale 's and saks fifth avenue department-store chains are for sale 
 many papers throughout the country are also faced with a slowdown in <unk> spending a booming category for newspapers in recent years 
 until recently industry analysts believed <unk> in retail ad spending had <unk> out and would in fact increase in this year 's third and fourth quarters 
 all bets are off analysts say because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains 
 improved paper prices will help offset weakness in <unk> but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad <unk> they usually run said edward j. <unk> industry analyst for salomon brothers inc 
 retailers are just in disarray 
 for instance <unk> co. posted an N N gain in net income as total ad pages dropped at usa today but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates 
 <unk> 's N daily and N <unk> newspapers reported a N N increase in advertising and circulation revenue 
 total advertising <unk> was modestly lower as <unk> volume increased while there was softer demand for retail and national ad <unk> said john <unk> <unk> 's chief executive officer 
 at usa today ad pages totaled N for the quarter down N N from the N period which was helped by increased ad spending from the summer olympics 
 while usa today 's total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled N a decrease of N N from last year the paper 's ad revenue increased N N in the quarter and N N in the nine months 
 in the nine months <unk> 's net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue gained N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 at dow jones & co. third-quarter net income fell N N from the year-earlier period 
 net fell to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share 
 the year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $ N million or four cents a share 
 revenue gained N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the drop in profit reflected in part continued softness in financial advertising at the wall street journal and barron 's magazine 
 ad <unk> at the journal fell N N in the third quarter 
 affiliated publications inc. reversed a year-earlier third quarter net loss 
 the publisher of the boston globe reported net of $ N million or N cents a share compared with a loss of $ N million or N cents a share for the third quarter in N 
 william o. taylor the parent 's chairman and chief executive officer said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the boston newspaper 
 third-quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint which in the last two years has had several price increases 
 after a supply crunch caused prices to rise N N since N to $ N a metric ton analysts are encouraged because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year 
 companies with daily newspapers in the northeast will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad <unk> 
 mr. <unk> at salomon brothers said he estimates that times mirror co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter because of soft advertising levels at its long island <unk> and hartford <unk> newspapers 
 trouble on the east coast was likely offset by improved ad <unk> at the los angeles times which this week also unveiled a <unk> 
 new york times co. is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship new york times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate forest products group 
 times co. 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well but there is little sign that things will improve in the new york market said alan <unk> an analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
 washington post co. is expected to report improved earnings largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the washington area 
 according to analysts profits were also helped by successful cost-cutting measures at newsweek 
 the <unk> has faced heightened competition from rival time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market 
 knight-ridder inc. is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its detroit free press and <unk> 's detroit news and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter 
 however analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers such as the miami herald and san jose mercury news 
 the miami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years when knight-ridder was starting up a hispanic edition and circulation was falling said bruce <unk> an analyst for <unk> national bank 
 general motors corp. in a series of moves that angered union officials in the u.s. and canada has signaled that as many as five north american assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess <unk> capacity 
 in announcements to workers late last week gm effectively signed death <unk> for two <unk> van assembly plants and cast serious doubt on the futures of three u.s. car factories 
 gm is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's u.s. market share skidded during the past decade 
 the company currently using about N N of its north american vehicle capacity has vowed it will run at N N of capacity by N 
 just a month ago gm announced it would make an aging assembly plant in <unk> ga. the eighth u.s. assembly facility to close since N 
 now gm appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s 
 one reason is mounting competition from new japanese car plants in the u.s. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than gm can match 
 another is that united auto workers union officials have signaled they want tighter <unk> provisions in the new big three national contract that will be negotiated next year 
 gm officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin 
 the problem however is that gm 's moves are coming at a time when <unk> leaders are trying to <unk> <unk> who charge the union is too passive in the face of gm layoffs 
 against that backdrop <unk> vice president stephen p. <unk> who recently became head of the union 's gm department issued a statement friday <unk> gm 's <unk> <unk> toward union members 
 the auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest <unk> and product <unk> <unk> out in separate <unk> to the affected plants showed disarray and an inability or <unk> to provide consistent information mr. <unk> said 
 gm officials told workers late last week of the following moves production of <unk> vans will be consolidated into a single plant in <unk> mich 
 that means two plants one in <unk> ontario and the other in <unk> ohio probably will be shut down after the end of N 
 the <unk> will idle about N canadian assembly workers and about N workers in ohio 
 robert white canadian auto workers union president used the impending <unk> shutdown to <unk> the <unk> free trade agreement and its champion prime minister brian <unk> 
 but canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate gm move that affects three u.s. car plants and one in quebec 
 workers at plants in van <unk> calif. oklahoma city and <unk> mich. were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the <unk> <unk> and chevrolet <unk> muscle cars 
 gm is studying whether it can build the new <unk> profitably at a plant in st. <unk> quebec company and union officials said 
 that announcement left union officials in van <unk> and oklahoma city uncertain about their futures 
 the van <unk> plant which employs about N workers does n't have a product to build after N 
 jerry <unk> <unk> local president said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a <unk> plant which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand 
 at the oklahoma city plant which employs about N workers building the <unk> <unk> <unk> cars steve <unk> <unk> local vice president said the plant has no new product lined up and none of us knows when the <unk> cars will die 
 he said he believes gm has plans to keep building <unk> cars into the mid-1990s 
 at <unk> however the <unk> decision appears to <unk> <unk> hopes that gm would reopen the <unk> assembly plant that last built the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> model 
 the <unk> plant was viewed as a model of <unk> cooperation at gm before slow sales of the <unk> forced the company to close the factory last year 
 union officials have taken a beating politically as a result 
 dissident <unk> members have used the <unk> plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation 's failure 
 <unk> merieux s.a. of france said the canadian government raised an obstacle to its proposed acquisition of connaught <unk> inc. for N million canadian dollars us$ N million 
 merieux said the government 's minister of industry science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of net benefit to canada 
 canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard 
 the french company said the government gave it N days in which to submit information to further support its takeover plan 
 both merieux and connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns 
 the government 's action was unusual 
 alan <unk> executive vice president of investment canada which oversees foreign takeovers said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse <unk> decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company 
 he said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed 
 this is n't a change in government policy this provision has been used before said <unk> redmond press secretary for <unk> <unk> canada 's minister of industry science and technology 
 mr. <unk> issued the ruling based on a recommendation by investment canada 
 spokesmen for merieux and connaught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or investment canada but added they hope to have more information early this week 
 investment canada declined to comment on the reasons for the government decision 
 <unk> mehta a partner with mehta & <unk> a new york-based pharmaceutical industry research firm said the government 's ruling was n't unexpected 
 this has become a very <unk> deal concerning canada 's only large <unk> <unk> or pharmaceutical company mr. mehta said 
 mr. mehta said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an <unk> settlement of connaught 's dispute with the university of toronto 
 the university is seeking to block the acquisition of connaught by foreign interests citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in canada 
 the university is considering a settlement proposal made by connaught 
 while neither side will disclose its <unk> mr. mehta expects it to contain more specific guarantees on research and development spending levels in canada than merieux offered to investment canada 
 some analysts such as murray <unk> of toronto-based <unk> <unk> inc. believe the government ruling leaves the door open for other bidders such as switzerland 's ciba-geigy and chiron corp. of <unk> calif 
 officials for the two concerns which are bidding c$ N a share for connaught could n't be reached for comment 
 french state-owned rhone-poulenc s.a. holds N N of merieux 
 <unk> international inc. said it canceled plans for a <unk> swap but may resume payment of dividends on the stock and added that it expects to publicly offer about N million common shares 
 the company said it planned to offer an <unk> number of common shares in exchange for the N shares of its preferred stock outstanding 
 the exchange ratio was never established 
 <unk> said market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange 
 the <unk> concern said however that in january N it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock 
 <unk> suspended its <unk> payment in october N and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in <unk> about $ N million but will do so some time in the future 
 additionally the company said it filed with the securities and exchange commission for the proposed offering of N million shares of common stock expected to be offered in november 
 the company said salomon brothers inc. and howard weil <unk> <unk> inc. underwriters for the offering were granted an option to buy as much as an additional N million shares to cover <unk> 
 proceeds will be used to eliminate and restructure bank debt 
 <unk> currently has approximately N million common shares outstanding 
 earnings for most of the nation 's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead <unk> in the third quarter as companies with newer <unk> prescription drugs fared especially well 
 for the third consecutive quarter however most of the companies ' revenues were battered by adverse foreign-currency <unk> as a result of the strong dollar abroad 
 analysts said that merck & co. eli lilly & co. warner-lambert co. and the squibb corp. unit of bristol-myers squibb co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new <unk> <unk> that provide wide profit margins 
 less robust earnings at pfizer inc. and upjohn co. were attributed to those companies ' older products many of which face <unk> competition from generic drugs and other <unk> 
 joseph <unk> an analyst with bear stearns & co. said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their <unk> businesses and instituted other cost savings such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs 
 as a result major new products are having significant impact even on a company with very large revenues mr. <unk> said 
 analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers as a group is estimated to have climbed between N N and N N 
 while that 's not spectacular neil <unk> an analyst with prudential <unk> said that the rate of growth will look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward 
 mr. <unk> estimated that merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about N N propelled by sales of its <unk> of fast-growing prescription drugs including its <unk> drug <unk> a high blood pressure medicine <unk> <unk> an <unk> and <unk> an <unk> medication 
 profit climbed even though merck 's sales were reduced by one to three percentage points as a result of the strong dollar mr. <unk> said 
 in the third quarter of N merck earned $ N million or N cents a share 
 in <unk> n.j. a merck spokesman said the company does n't make earnings projections 
 mr. <unk> said he estimated that lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about N N largely because of the performance of its new <unk> <unk> 
 the drug introduced last year is expected to generate sales of about $ N million this year 
 it 's turning out to be a real blockbuster mr. <unk> said 
 in last year 's third quarter lilly earned $ N million or $ N a share 
 in indianapolis lilly declined comment 
 several analysts said they expected warner-lambert 's profit also to increase by more than N N from $ N million or $ N a share it reported in the like period last year 
 the company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins 
 the company 's lean operation analysts said allowed <unk> sales from its cholesterol drug <unk> to power earnings growth 
 <unk> sales are expected to be about $ N million this year up from $ N million in N 
 in morris plains n.j. a spokesman for the company said the analysts ' projections are in the <unk> 
 squibb 's profit estimated by analysts to be about N N above the $ N million or $ N a share it earned in the third quarter of N was the result of especially strong sales of its <unk> drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease 
 the company was officially merged with bristol-myers co. earlier this month 
 bristol-myers declined to comment 
 mr. <unk> of bear stearns said that schering-plough corp. 's expected profit rise of about N N to N N and <unk> 's expected profit increase of about N N are largely because those companies are really managed well 
 <unk> earned $ N million or N cents a share while bristol-myers earned $ N million or N cents a share in the like period a year earlier 
 in madison n.j. a spokesman for schering-plough said the company has no problems with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about N N to $ N 
 the company expects to achieve the N N increase in full-year earnings per share as it projected in the spring the spokesman said 
 meanwhile analysts said pfizer 's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about N N 
 sales of pfizer 's important drugs <unk> for treating <unk> and <unk> a heart medicine have <unk> because of increased competition 
 the strong dollar hurt pfizer a lot too mr. <unk> said 
 in the third quarter last year pfizer earned $ N million or $ N a share 
 in new york the company declined comment 
 analysts said they expected upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about N N to N N as compared with $ N million or N cents a share it earned a year ago 
 upjohn 's <unk> drugs are <unk> a <unk> and <unk> a <unk> 
 sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the <unk> of certain <unk> <unk> and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs 
 also the company 's <unk> drug <unk> is selling well at about $ N million for the year but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced by upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising analysts said 
 in <unk> mich. upjohn declined comment 
 amid a crowd of <unk> stocks <unk> technology inc. 's stock fell particularly hard friday dropping N N because its problems were compounded by disclosure of an unexpected loss for its fiscal first quarter

 gulf resources & chemical corp. said it agreed to pay $ N million as part of an accord with the environmental protection agency regarding an environmental cleanup of a <unk> <unk> the company formerly operated in idaho 
 in N the epa notified gulf resources which was a <unk> of the <unk> that it was potentially liable for sharing cleanup costs at the site under the federal superfund program 
 the <unk> area is <unk> with lead <unk> and other metals 
 gulf resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a <unk> concern potentially <unk> it from liability for the <unk> 's cleanup costs 
 the company said that as part of its agreement with the epa it made certain voluntary <unk> with respect to <unk> transactions entered into after the reorganization 
 the company which issued a statement on the agreement late friday said that $ N million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ N will be recognized in its N third-quarter statement 
 the agreement and consent <unk> are subject to court approval the company said 
 gulf resources added that it will seek to recover equitable contribution from others for both the amount of the settlement and any other liabilities it may incur under the superfund law 
 under the agreement gulf must give the u.s. government N days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock 
 the company 's net worth can not fall below $ N million after the dividends are issued 
 the terms of that agreement only become effective the date of gulf 's reorganization which we anticipate will occur sometime in early N said lawrence r. mehl gulf 's general counsel 
 in addition gulf must give the government N days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ N million that are made to the <unk> holding company 
 gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be at least $ N million 
 separately the company said it expects to hold a special meeting for shareholders in early N to vote on its proposed reorganization 
 many of the nation 's <unk> executives <unk> friday 's market plunge as an overdue <unk> for speculators and takeover players 
 assuming that the market does n't head into a <unk> free fall some executives think friday 's action could prove a <unk> of good news as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be <unk> 
 this is a reaction to <unk> lbo <unk> rather than to any fundamentals said john young chairman of hewlett-packard co. whose shares dropped $ N to $ N 
 if we get rid of a lot of that nonsense it will be a big plus 
 a few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the business council a group that meets to discuss national issues were only too happy to <unk> their criticism 
 people wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs do something about takeovers do something about donald trump said rand <unk> chairman of itt corp. whose stock dropped $ N 
 where 's the leadership 
 where 's the guy who can say enough is enough 
 the executives were <unk> <unk> by the plunge even though it <unk> billions of dollars off the value of their companies and millions off their personal fortunes 
 i 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline said kenneth <unk> digital equipment corp. president who was <unk> <unk> through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the <unk> here after his company 's shares plunged $ N to close at $ N 
 i did n't bother calling anybody i did n't even turn on tv 
 there has n't been any fundamental change in the economy added john <unk> whose procter & gamble co. took an $ N slide to close at $ N 
 the fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem 
 of course established corporate <unk> often tend to <unk> the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists 
 indeed one chief executive who was downright <unk> by friday 's events was robert crandall chairman of amr corp. the parent of american airlines and the target of a takeover offer by mr. trump 
 asked whether friday 's action could help him avoid being <unk> by the new york real estate <unk> mr. crandall <unk> broadly and said no comment 
 on friday morning before the market 's sell-off the business leaders issued a report predicting the economy would grow at roughly an inflation-adjusted N N annual rate through next year then accelerate <unk> in N 
 of the N economists who worked on the business council forecast only two projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years and in both <unk> the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession said lewis <unk> chairman of j.p. morgan & co. and vice chairman of the business council 
 the real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of new york office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market 
 in manhattan <unk> store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill 
 retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy turmoil in their own industries and a belief that <unk> have not yet hit bottom 
 there is an <unk> amount of space available says faith <unk> senior vice president at <unk> associates store leasing inc 
 there are about N stores for rent up from a more typical range of N to N 
 this further <unk> retailers she says 
 they wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down 
 is this the wrong time to open a store 
 who is going to be in the space next door 
 in addition ms. <unk> says tenants usually can negotiate to pay <unk> that are about <unk> lower than <unk> ' initial asking price 
 a handful of hot retail locations such as the <unk> street and madison and fifth avenue areas have been able to sustain what many see as <unk> <unk> 
 and in some neighborhoods <unk> have merely hit a <unk> 
 but on average manhattan retail <unk> have dropped N N to N N in the past six months alone experts say 
 that follows a more <unk> decline in the prior six months after manhattan <unk> had run up rapidly since N 
 the same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing 
 as businesses contract or <unk> the number of employees who might use retail services <unk> says edward a. <unk> senior vice president of helmsley <unk> inc 
 he says financial problems <unk> electronics fur and furniture companies key categories in the local retail economy have further <unk> the market 
 hardest hit are what he calls secondary sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents 
 in these locations mr. <unk> says retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and <unk> have remained steady or in some cases have declined 
 weakness in the restaurant industry which is leaving retail space vacant <unk> the problem for <unk> 
 it is also no comfort to <unk> and small new york retailers when the future of larger department stores which <unk> retail neighborhoods are in doubt 
 hooker corp. parent of <unk> teller and b. altman 's is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner campeau corp 
 the trend toward lower <unk> may seem surprising given that some communities in new york are <unk> the loss of favorite local businesses to high <unk> 
 but despite the recent softening for many of these retailers there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s when their leases were signed 
 certainly the recent drop in prices does n't mean manhattan comes cheap 
 new york retail <unk> still run well above the going rate in other u.s. cities 
 madison and fifth <unk> and east <unk> street can command <unk> of up to $ N a square foot and $ N is not uncommon 
 the thriving <unk> street area offers <unk> of about $ N a square foot as do <unk> locations along lower fifth avenue 
 by contrast <unk> in the best retail locations in boston san francisco and chicago rarely top $ N a square foot 
 and <unk> on beverly hills ' <unk> drive generally do n't exceed about $ N a square foot

 when justice william <unk> marks the start of his <unk> year on the supreme court today the occasion will differ sharply from previous <unk> of his tenure 
 for the first time the <unk> justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent rather than as a force in the high court 's majority 
 this role reversal holds true as well for his three liberal and moderate allies justices <unk> marshall harry <unk> and john stevens 
 but are these four players three of them in their <unk> ready to assume a different role after N years <unk> of service on the high court 
 every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role and the <unk> that go with it but in different ways 
 justices <unk> and stevens appear <unk> about it justices marshall and <unk> appear fighting mad 
 the four justices are no newcomers to dissent often joining forces in the past decade to <unk> the court 's conservative <unk> 
 but always in years past they have <unk> the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to <unk> out a number of major victories in civil rights and <unk> cases 
 now however as the court 's new <unk> conservative majority continues to <unk> victories for the liberals are rare 
 the change is most dramatic for justice <unk> the last <unk> of the <unk> liberal majority under chief justice <unk> warren 
 in the seven supreme court terms from the fall of N through the spring of N the <unk> of the warren court 's power justice <unk> cast only N <unk> votes in N cases decided by the court 
 last term alone he cast N <unk> votes in N decisions with the contentious <unk> ruling as his only big victory 
 but justice <unk> <unk> his new role strongly defending the importance of <unk> in a N speech 
 each time the court <unk> an issue the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to <unk> the result he said 
 moreover in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s he knew that the tables might turn in the future 
 he has said that he now knows how justice john <unk> felt a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent <unk> from the warren court 's opinions 
 associates of <unk> justice marshall say he was depressed about the court 's direction last spring but is <unk> about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights 
 we could sweep it under the <unk> and hide it but i 'm not going to do it he said in a speech last month 
 he like justice <unk> considers <unk> highly important for the future a point that has n't escaped legal scholars 
 harvard law school professor laurence tribe says there is a <unk> flavor to current <unk> 
 the <unk> in the warren court he says appeared to be writing for the short-term suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon 
 <unk> and marshall are speaking in their <unk> to a more distant future he says 
 justice <unk> who will turn N next month also seems <unk> about his new role 
 associates say he takes some <unk> more personally than his colleagues especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his N opinion roe vs. wade 
 friends and associates who saw justice <unk> during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years 
 and his outlook improved after successful <unk> surgery in august 
 but his level of frustration showed in a recent <unk> speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in chicago 
 he concluded his remarks by <unk> <unk> and at some length according to those present the late martin <unk> king 's famous i have a dream speech from the N march on washington 
 justice stevens N is probably the most <unk> of the <unk> about his role in part because he may be the least liberal of the four but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others 
 if the role these four <unk> are assuming is a familiar one in modern supreme court history it also <unk> in an important way from recent history court watchers say 
 the <unk> of the warren court were often defending a legal <unk> that they inherited says prof. <unk> dick howard of the university of virginia law school but the <unk> today are defending a <unk> that they created 
 the government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions in its first wave of sales of big sick thrifts but low bids prevented the sale of a fifth 
 the four s&ls were sold to large banks as was the case with most of the N previous transactions initiated by the resolution trust corp. since it was created in the s&l bailout legislation two months ago 
 two of the four big thrifts were sold to ncnb corp. charlotte n.c. which has aggressively expanded its markets particularly in texas and florida 
 a canadian bank bought another thrift in the first rtc transaction with a foreign bank 
 under these deals the rtc sells just the deposits and the healthy assets 
 these <unk> transactions leave the bulk of bad assets mostly real estate with the government to be sold later 
 in these four for instance the rtc is stuck with $ N billion in bad assets 
 <unk> paid premiums ranging from N N to N N for the deposits and branch systems roughly in line with what analysts were expecting 
 the buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks as has been the case with previous deals 
 after that the buyers may <unk> the rates paid by the former thrifts 
 but it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps 
 ncnb for example has been one of the highest rate <unk> in the texas market and in florida rates are especially sensitive in retirement communities 
 the rtc had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines but the delays illustrate the tough <unk> facing the agency 
 these thrifts are <unk> <unk> said <unk> <unk> an industry consultant based in <unk> va 
 for example the delay in selling people 's heritage savings <unk> kan. with $ N billion in assets has forced the rtc to consider selling off the thrift <unk> instead of as a whole institution 
 ncnb continued its <unk> into the florida and texas markets 
 ncnb will acquire university federal savings association houston which had assets of $ N billion 
 ncnb texas national bank will pay the rtc a premium of $ N million for $ N billion in deposits 
 as a measure of the <unk> to which the texas real estate market has <unk> the rtc will pay $ N billion to ncnb to take $ N million of bad assets 
 ncnb also acquired freedom savings & loan association tampa fla. which had total assets of $ N million 
 ncnb will pay the rtc a premium of $ N million for $ N billion in deposits 
 ncnb will also acquire $ N million of freedom 's assets from the rtc which will require $ N million in assistance 
 meridian bancorp inc. reading pa. will acquire hill financial savings association red hill pa. which had $ N billion in assets 
 meridian will pay a premium of $ N million to assume $ N billion in deposits 
 it will also purchase $ N million of the thrift 's assets with $ N billion in rtc assistance 
 in the first rtc transaction with a foreign buyer royal <unk> ltd. toronto will acquire pacific savings bank costa mesa calif. which had $ N million in assets 
 royal <unk> will pay the rtc $ N million to assume $ N million in deposits 
 it will also purchase $ N million in assets and receive $ N million in assistance from the rtc

 time magazine in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise <unk> 
 in an announcement to its staff last week executives at time warner inc. 's weekly magazine said time will dramatically <unk> its use of electronic <unk> such as telephones in television subscription drives cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by N to four million and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ N to $ N 
 in a related development the <unk> for the fourth year in a row said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in N a full <unk> page in the magazine costs about $ N 
 however because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered ad rates will be effectively N N higher per subscriber according to richard <unk> time associate publisher 
 time is following the course of some other <unk> magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing <unk> that maintaining artificially high and expensive <unk> is the way to draw advertisers 
 in recent years reader 's digest new york times co. 's mccall 's and most recently news corp. 's tv guide have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers 
 deep discounts in <unk> and offers of free <unk> <unk> and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the <unk> world of magazine <unk> 
 but time as part of the more <unk> time warner wants to <unk> itself away from expensive <unk> 
 besides time executives think selling a news magazine with a <unk> radio is <unk> 
 <unk> just give people the wrong image said mr. <unk> 
 that perception takes the focus off the magazine 
 time magazine executives predictably <unk> the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers 
 what we are doing is <unk> out the readers who are only <unk> related to the magazine and do n't really read it said mr. <unk> 
 we are trying to create quality and involvement 
 however time executives used the same explanation when in october N the magazine cut its guaranteed circulation from N million to N million 
 and time 's paid circulation according to audit bureau of <unk> dropped N N to N in the six months ended june N N 
 still time 's move is being received well once again 
 it 's <unk> for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more said michael <unk> national media director at bozell inc. ad agency 
 a few drops in circulation are of no consequence 
 it 's not a show of weakness they are improving the quality of circulation while <unk> their profits 
 mr. <unk> said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away 
 the question is how much are we getting from each reader said mr. <unk> 
 time 's rivals <unk> washington post co. 's newsweek and u.s. news & world report are less <unk> on electronic <unk> and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases 
 both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for N within a month 
 when the news broke of an attempted coup in panama two weeks ago sen. christopher dodd called the state department for a briefing 
 they said follow <unk> he told reporters 
 that shows how far ted turner 's cable news network has come since its birth nine years ago when it was considered the <unk> of television news 
 it is bigger faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks 
 its niche as the network of record during major crises draws elite audiences around the world 
 but for all its success <unk> has hit a <unk> 
 although <unk> <unk> when big news breaks it <unk> during periods of calm 
 <unk> executives worry that the network 's <unk> but <unk> news format may be getting <unk> and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives <unk> for news and information on cable-tv 
 just the fact we 're on N hours is no longer <unk> says ed turner <unk> 's executive vice president news gathering and no <unk> to ted turner 
 you ca n't live on that 
 so <unk> a unit of atlanta-based turner broadcasting system inc. is trying to <unk> itself as a primary channel or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network 
 tonight to kick off the effort <unk> will premiere its first prime-time <unk> in years an <unk> show at N p.m eastern time to air <unk> against the network <unk> 
 the show will be <unk> by bernard shaw and <unk> <unk> a <unk> former texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism 
 the new show is perhaps the <unk> in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more <unk> signature programming with <unk> stars 
 to <unk> itself <unk> is also expanding international coverage and adding a second <unk> program 
 it is paying higher salaries after years of <unk> to lure and keep experienced staffers 
 and it is <unk> on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large <unk> team 
 the next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables says jon <unk> executive vice president of headline news <unk> 's sister network 
 but that wo n't be easy 
 networks like other consumer products develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change 
 it also takes money that <unk> has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see 
 and the cable-tv operators <unk> 's distributors and part owners like things just the way they are 
 the <unk> bid is aimed at <unk> 's <unk> <unk> and what may happen to it as the cable-tv news market grows more competitive 
 already <unk> is facing stronger competition from financial news network inc. and general electric co. 's consumer news and business channel both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future 
 in addition many cable-tv systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations 
 <unk> wants to change its viewers ' habits 
 its watchers are on the whole a <unk> group of <unk> <unk> and news <unk> who spend an average of just N minutes a day watching <unk> according to audience research 
 that 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks 
 the brief attention viewers give <unk> could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data and advertising become more important to cable-tv channels 
 <unk> 's <unk> habits have been <unk> by its format 
 its strategy in the past has been to serve as a tv wire service 
 it focused on building up its news bureaus around the world so as events took place it could go live <unk> and longer than other networks 
 it filled its daily schedule with <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but the shows <unk> little in content <unk> or look 
 now the push is on for <unk> shows 
 our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity says paul <unk> <unk> executive vice president for programming 
 <unk> <unk> is adding a <unk> show in the morning because surveys show its <unk> hour in the afternoon is among its most <unk> programs in viewers ' minds says mr. <unk> 
 and it is exploring other original programs similar to its larry king live and <unk> talk shows which executives hope will keep people <unk> in 
 then there 's the world today the prime-time <unk> featuring mr. shaw and ms. <unk> 
 until now <unk> has featured its hollywood <unk> show during the key evening period 
 but N N of the <unk> households that watch news do so between N p.m. and N p.m. the network discovered so <unk> wants in 
 mr. <unk> says the <unk> team will probably do two live interviews a day with most of the program at least for now appearing similar to <unk> 's other <unk> 
 some in the industry are skeptical 
 i find it hard to <unk> of people switching over to <unk> for what at least in the public 's mind is the same news says <unk> frank the former <unk> president of nbc news and <unk> of the <unk> report 
 the evening news is also slated as <unk> 's stage for its big push into <unk> journalism 
 in august the network hired <unk> producer <unk> hill the former head of news <unk> at abc 
 she 's <unk> a staff of about N <unk> reporters who will produce weekly <unk> segments with an eye toward breaking big stories 
 <unk> executives hope the <unk> created by such <unk> will generate excitement for its <unk> programs in the way N minutes did so well for cbs 
 that 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical <unk> will follow through with its <unk> commitment especially after it sees the cost of producing <unk> pieces 
 they 've never shown any <unk> to spend money on production says michael <unk> a senior producer with <unk> <unk> who notes that <unk> is <unk> to his job 
 the network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards resulting in a <unk> work force 
 <unk> recently gave most employees raises of as much as N N but they 're still drastically <unk> compared with the networks 
 says mr. <unk> <unk> is my wire service they 're on top of everything 
 but to improve they 've really got to make the investment in people 
 in any case <unk> operators have reason to fear any <unk> with <unk> 's format 
 they market cable-tv on the very <unk> opportunities <unk> seeks to discourage 
 we would obviously be upset if those kinds of services <unk> into more <unk> <unk> programming says robert <unk> senior vice president programming of continental <unk> inc. which holds a N N stake in turner broadcasting 
 the second u.s. circuit court of appeals opinion in the <unk> <unk> case did not <unk> the position pennzoil co. took in its dispute with texaco contrary to your sept. N article court backs texaco 's view in pennzoil case too late 
 the fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound 
 in the <unk> litigation the courts found pennzoil and <unk> oil intended to be bound in <unk> <unk> they found there was no intention to be bound 
 <unk> the principle in the cases is the same 
 but the outcome of a legal dispute almost always turns on the facts 
 and the facts as found by the various courts in these two lawsuits were different 
 when you suggest otherwise you leave the <unk> of reporting and enter the <unk> of speculation

 valley federal savings & loan association said imperial corp. of america withdrew from regulators its application to buy five valley federal branches leaving the transaction in limbo 
 the broken purchase appears as additional evidence of trouble at imperial corp. whose spokesman said the company withdrew its application from the federal office of thrift supervision because of an informal notice that imperial 's thrift unit failed to meet community reinvestment act requirements 
 the community reinvestment act requires savings and loan associations to lend money in amounts related to areas where deposits are received 
 the transaction announced in august included about $ N million in deposits at the five outlets in california 's san <unk> valley

 the thrifts ' lawyers claim that the suits <unk> N to N in texas alone should be dismissed as <unk> because neither the s&ls nor the <unk> federal savings and loan insurance corp. has the money to pay judgments 
 though the argument may have a <unk> ring to it even the s&l lawyers concede there 's little precedent to back their position 
 still one federal appeals court has signaled it 's willing to <unk> the notion and the lawyers have renewed their arguments in texas and eight other states where the defense is permitted under state law 
 the dismissal of the pending suits could go a long way toward clearing court <unk> in texas and reducing the <unk> 's massive legal bills which topped $ N million last year 
 the s&l lawyers were encouraged last month by an <unk> ruling in two cases brought against <unk> <unk> savings & loan association of dallas by the developers of the valley ranch best known as the training center for the dallas cowboys football team 
 <unk> foreclosed on the ranch 
 <unk> and the <unk> argued to the fifth u.s. circuit court of appeals that there will never be any assets with which to satisfy a judgment against <unk> savings nor any means to collect from any other party including <unk> 
 if true the court wrote this <unk> would justify dismissal of these actions on prudential grounds 
 but the court said it lacked enough financial information about <unk> and the <unk> and sent the cases back to federal district court in dallas 
 charles <unk> a lawyer for <unk> says he plans to file a brief this week urging the district judge to dismiss the suits because <unk> 's liabilities exceeded its assets by about $ N billion when federal regulators closed it in august N

 september 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still <unk> and the <unk> over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge friday 
 after falling for three consecutive months the producer price index for finished goods shot up N N last month the labor department reported friday as energy prices jumped after tumbling through the summer 
 although the report which was released before the stock market opened did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the dow jones industrial average analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline 
 analysts immediately viewed the price data the <unk> inflation news in months as evidence that the federal reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped 
 further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the fed from easing credit the commerce department reported friday that retail sales grew N N in september to $ N billion 
 that rise came on top of a N N gain in august and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy 
 i think the friday report combined with the actions of the fed weakened the belief that there was going to be an imminent easing of monetary policy said robert <unk> chief economist at northern trust co. in chicago 
 but economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers 
 the overall N N increase is serious in itself but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy the producer price index still increased by N N said gordon <unk> an economist at the national association of manufacturers 
 but sung won <unk> chief economist at <unk> corp. in minneapolis blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the september jump 
 i would say this is not bad news this is a <unk> he said 
 the core rate is not really out of line 
 all year energy prices have <unk> the producer price index which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods 
 inflation <unk> has fallen back from its <unk> pace last winter when a steep <unk> in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates 
 energy prices then plummeted through the summer causing the index to decline for three consecutive months 
 overall the index has climbed at a N N compound annual rate since the start of the year the labor department said 
 while far more <unk> than the pace at the beginning of the year that is still a <unk> rise than the N N increase for all of N 
 moreover this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month when energy prices <unk> up N N after plunging N N in august 
 some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain 
 analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index but the N N climb was higher than most anticipated 
 i think the <unk> in inflation is going to continue for a few months said john <unk> chief economist at bell <unk> <unk> a washington economic forecasting firm 
 he predicted that inflation will moderate next year saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide 
 but <unk> van <unk> president of the national association of <unk> said that last month 's rise is n't as bad an <unk> as the N N figure suggests 
 if you examine the data carefully the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods he explained 
 passenger car prices jumped N N in september after climbing N N in august and declining in the late spring and summer 
 many analysts said the september increase was a one-time event coming as dealers introduced their N models 
 although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations car prices rose beyond the <unk> autumn increase 
 prices for capital equipment rose a hefty N N in september while prices for home electronic equipment fell N N 
 food prices declined N N after climbing N N in august 
 meanwhile the retail sales report showed that car sales rose N N in september to $ N billion 
 but at least part of the increase could have come from higher prices analysts said 
 sales at general merchandise stores rose N N after declining N N in august while sales of building materials fell N N after rising N N 
 producer prices for intermediate goods grew N N in september after dropping for three consecutive months 
 prices for crude goods an array of raw materials jumped N N after declining N N in august and <unk> up N N in july 
 here are the labor department 's producer price indexes N <unk> N for september before seasonal adjustment and the percentage changes from september N 
 <unk> financial corp. said it expects to report a loss of at least $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter 
 in the year-earlier period <unk> had net income of $ N but no per-share earnings 
 <unk> 's president and chief executive officer john <unk> said the loss stems from several factors 
 he said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ N million from $ N million between june and september 
 approximately N N of the total <unk> of nonperforming commercial real estate assets 
 <unk> <unk> estimated that it will provide between $ N million and $ N million for credit losses in the third quarter 
 <unk> added that significant additional loan-loss provisions may be required by federal regulators as part of the current annual examination of city federal savings bank <unk> 's primary subsidiary based in <unk> n.j 
 city federal operates N banking offices in new jersey and florida 
 mr. <unk> said <unk> will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions <unk> themselves of such bonds 
 that action <unk> said will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $ N million 
 <unk> also said it expects to shed its remaining mortgage loan <unk> operations outside its principal markets in new jersey and florida and as a result is taking a charge for discontinued operations 
 all these actions mr. <unk> said will result in a loss of $ N million to $ N million for the third quarter 
 he added however depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages <unk> and the outcome of the annual examination of city federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range 
 centrust savings bank said federal thrift regulators ordered it to suspend dividend payments on its two classes of preferred stock indicating that regulators ' concerns about the troubled institution have heightened 
 in a statement miami-based centrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and apparent losses in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends 
 regulators also ordered centrust to stop buying back the preferred stock 
 david l. paul chairman and chief executive officer criticized the federal office of thrift supervision which issued the <unk> saying it was inappropriate and based on insufficient reasons 
 he said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision 
 the suspension of a preferred stock dividend is a serious step that signals that regulators have deep concerns about an institution 's health 
 in march regulators labeled centrust a troubled institution largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses 
 in the same month the office of thrift supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track 
 for the nine months ended june N centrust had a net loss of $ N million compared with year-earlier net income of $ N million 
 centrust which is florida 's largest thrift holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation 
 since april it has <unk> its high-yield bond holdings to about $ N million from $ N billion 
 mr. paul said only about $ N million of the current holdings are <unk> securities registered with the securities and exchange commission 
 the remainder he said are commercial loan <unk> or private <unk> that are n't filed with the sec and do n't have a ready market 
 centrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market <unk> for the junk bonds 
 the office of thrift supervision has been <unk> centrust to provide current market values for its holdings but centrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative <unk> of the bonds and lack of a ready market 
 regulators have become increasingly <unk> about centrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market 
 the legislation requires thrifts to <unk> themselves of junk bonds in the new <unk> regulatory climate 
 in american stock exchange composite trading friday centrust common shares closed at $ N down N cents 
 in a statement friday mr. paul challenged the regulators ' decision saying the thrift 's operating losses and apparent junk-bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank 
 he also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds 
 in the third quarter for instance centrust added $ N million to its general reserves 
 mr. paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with <unk> centrust 's request to sell N of its N branches to great western bank a unit of great western financial corp. based in beverly hills calif 
 the branch sale is the centerpiece of centrust 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional s&l from a <unk> institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits according to mr. paul 
 most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction which was announced in july long before now 
 many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal 
 branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution 
 centrust however <unk> the branch sale saying it would bring in $ N million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 it said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ N million or about N N of assets from a negative $ N million as of sept. N thus bringing centrust close to regulatory standards 
 centrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ N million 
 critics however say the branch sale will make centrust more dependent than ever on <unk> deposits and junk bonds 
 mr. paul <unk> that he intends to further <unk> the size of centrust by not renewing more than $ N billion of <unk> certificates of deposit when they come due 
 the thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate as required under the new thrift law 
 on a recent saturday night in the midst of west germany 's most popular prime-time show a <unk> bet the host that she could name any of N different <unk> after just one <unk> while <unk> 
 the woman won the bet 
 but perhaps even more remarkable the <unk> <unk> <unk> make a bet regularly wins the top <unk> in the country 's tv ratings sometimes drawing as many as N N of west german households 
 as the N economic integration approaches europe 's cultural <unk> have taken to the <unk> against american cultural <unk> threatening to impose quotas against such pop <unk> as dallas miami vice and l.a. law 
 but much of what the europeans want to protect seems every bit as <unk> as what they are trying to keep out 
 the most <unk> opposition to american tv imports has come from french television and movie producers who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full N N of europe 's tv shows be produced in europe 
 so far the french have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail 
 a <unk> through the television listings and a few <unk> of the european television dial suggest one reason why 
 while there are some popular action and drama series few <unk> the high culture and <unk> production values one might expect 
 more european air time is filled with <unk> game shows variety hours movies and talk shows many of which are authorized <unk> of their american counterparts 
 one of france 's most popular saturday night programs features <unk> seeking out their <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> 
 a <unk> game show has as its host a belgian <unk> to be italian 
 one of italy 's favorite shows <unk> a <unk> variety show is so popular that viewers <unk> to buy a <unk> product <unk> <unk> whose <unk> were sung each week by <unk> <unk> even though the product did n't exist 
 <unk> the <unk> <unk> on another typical evening of fun on <unk> <unk> a <unk> won a bet with the show 's host thomas <unk> that he could identify N german <unk> over the telephone 
 a celebrity guest u.s. ambassador to west germany richard burt also won a bet that someone could pile up $ N worth of quarters on a <unk> coin 
 mr. burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost agreeing to spend a day with west german foreign minister <unk> <unk> <unk> and selling their combined weight in potato <unk> 
 if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the <unk> barriers it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get 
 european programs usually target only their own local audience and often only a small portion of that 
 <unk> in germany or italy rarely make it even to france or great britain and almost never show up on u.s. screens 
 attempts to produce <unk> programs have generally resulted in disappointment 
 one annual <unk> the <unk> <unk> song contest featuring <unk> <unk> from each of N european countries has been described as the world 's most boring tv show 
 another <unk> <unk> <unk> where <unk> from <unk> european countries make <unk> of themselves performing <unk> tasks is a hit in france 
 a <unk> <unk> under the title almost anything goes <unk> fast 
 for the most part what 's made here stays here and for good reason 
 the <unk> of the british crop the literary <unk> that are shown on u.s. public television as <unk> theater make up a relatively small part of british air time 
 most british programming is more of an acquired taste 
 there is for instance one man and his dog a <unk> contest among sheep dogs 
 also <unk> to the british are hours of <unk> <unk> even more hours of lawn bowling <unk> and still more hours of <unk> <unk> 
 european drama has had better though still mixed fortunes 
 the most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns 
 a french <unk> of dallas called <unk> and set in a french <unk> had a good run in france which ended after the female lead was injured in a <unk> auto accident 
 <unk> black forest clinic a kind of german <unk> elsewhere set in a health <unk> is popular in germany and has spread into france 
 italy 's most popular series is a drama called la <unk> or the <unk> which <unk> the fight of an <unk> young investigator in <unk> against the mafia 
 it was <unk> news in italy earlier this year when the <unk> inspector was <unk> down in the series 
 spain 's most popular <unk> this year was <unk> the story of an aging <unk> 
 the trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular with american programs second says brian <unk> a former director of programs for the british broadcasting corp 
 given a choice everybody will watch a <unk> show 
 but frequently there is n't much choice 
 thus europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own programs with broader appeal 
 we 've basically got to start from <unk> to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see concedes <unk> young head of britain 's national film theatre school 
 while some in the u.s. contend that advertising is the <unk> of television here many believe that its absence is to blame for the european tv industry 's sluggish development 
 until recently national governments in europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising 
 since production costs were guaranteed it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into <unk> as most american programs are 
 but not much money was spent on the shows either a situation that encouraged <unk> talk and game shows while discouraging <unk> <unk> 
 now however commercial channels are coming to most european countries and at the same time satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly 
 just last week greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels 
 the result is a new and huge appetite for programming 
 but perhaps to the <unk> of those calling for quotas most of this <unk> is likely to be filled with the cheapest and most <unk> programming now available reruns usually of shows made in the u.s. 
 sky channel a <unk> venture of <unk> press <unk> rupert murdoch offers what must be a <unk> cultural mix to most of its audience 
 the financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available <unk> from its boss 's other ventures

 after two years of talks plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek french and british government clearance

 but neither <unk> nor <unk> unrelated to stamford <unk> general electric co. are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces 
 yesterday a source close to <unk> confirmed that his company may join the ferranti fight as part of a possible consortium that would bid against british aerospace and <unk> 
 companies with which <unk> has had talks about a possible joint ferranti bid include <unk> britain 's <unk> group plc west germany 's daimler-benz ag and france 's dassault group 
 but it may be weeks before <unk> and its potential partners decide whether to bid the source indicated 
 <unk> plans first to study ferranti 's financial accounts which auditors recently said included # N million in <unk> contracts at a u.s. unit international signal & control group with which ferranti merged last year 
 also any <unk> bid might be blocked by british antitrust regulators ferranti is <unk> 's main competitor on several key <unk> contracts and its purchase by <unk> may <unk> british defense ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry 
 a consortium bid however would <unk> <unk> 's direct role in ferranti and might consequently <unk> ministry officials 
 a british aerospace spokeswoman appeared <unk> by the prospect of a fight with <unk> for ferranti competition is the name of the game she said 
 at least one potential <unk> partner <unk> insists it is n't interested in ferranti 
 we have nothing to say about this affair which does n't concern us a <unk> official said sunday 
 the missile venture the british aerospace spokeswoman said is a needed response to the new environment in defense contracting 
 for both thomson and british aerospace earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly <unk> defense ministries and middle east sales a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices 
 the venture 's importance for thomson is great 
 thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other europeans 
 the european defense industry is consolidating for instance west germany 's siemens ag recently joined <unk> in a takeover of britain 's <unk> co. and daimler-benz agreed to buy <unk> <unk> g.m.b <unk>
